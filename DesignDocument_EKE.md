Summary
=======
The document describes a new feature which will be added to the MPAS-Analysis
tools package: visualization of Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE).
The EKE over much of the ocean is at least an order of magnitude greater than
the mean kinetic energy (MKE) (Wytrki, 1976).
This variability and can transport momentum, heat, mass, and chemical
consitutents of seawater (Robinson, 1983).
For high-resolution eddy-permitting MPAS-O experiments, it is important that
researchers have tools to visualize model predictions of EKE in order to
compare the model EKE to observations.

Science

- "...The named ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the Peru Current... are the home of "rings" spun off from major currents, and they have a complex eddy structure of their own." (Knauss p.186)
- "The energy sources are varied. They include Gulf Stream rings and analogous phenomena associated with other major currents, turbulence generated by currents passing over complex bottom topography and coastal jets associate with upwelling.  The strongest eddies are found near the strong western boundary currents." (Knauss p.186)
- Wytrki 1976
  - "The results are consistent with the idea that eddy motion in the ocean is generated in areas of strong mean shear flow and is subsequentlu distributed over the whole ocean."

    - Gulf stream: 2
    - Subtropical gyre: 1/20 - 1/40
- "The kinetic energy of mesoscale variability (scales of tens to hundreds of km and tens to hundreds of days) is more than an order of magnitude greater than the mean kinetic energy over most of the ocean [Wyrtki et al., 1976; Richardson, 1983]. Mesoscale variability occurs as linear Rossby waves and as nonlinear vortices or eddies. In contrast to linear waves, nonlinear vortices can transport momentum, heat, mass and the chemical constituents of seawater, and thereby contribute to the general circulation, large‚Äêscale water mass distributions, and ocean biology [Robinson, 1983]."
